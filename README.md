# @4lch4/Hue-Lights-API

This module/library is a fork/clone of the [`node-hue-api`][0] module created by Peter Murray. The reason I've created this version of it is because the structure/design of that library is rather convoluted and more complex than necessary (in my opinion). So, I've created this to trim off some of the fat and make it easier to use.

Again, this is entirely my opinion and how I prefer to interact with the Hue API.
